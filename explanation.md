Implemented the removal of the outdated Sphinx documentation workflow file as specified in the approved plan. The `.github/workflows/sphinx.yml` file contained Python-specific build steps including `pip install`, Sphinx documentation building, and GitHub Pages deployment that are not applicable to this React project. Removing this file will clean up the GitHub Actions configuration and eliminate a workflow that would fail if triggered since the project no longer has Python documentation structure.
