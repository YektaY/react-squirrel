  "raw_plan": "## Summary\n\nRemove the outdated Sphinx documentation workflow file `.github/workflows/sphinx.yml` that was left over from when this project was ported from Python to React. This is a simple cleanup task that requires only deleting a single file that's no longer applicable to this React project.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Locate the Sphinx workflow file** - Navigate to `.github/workflows/sphinx.yml` in the repository to confirm it exists and verify it's a Python Sphinx documentation workflow\n\n2. **Delete the workflow file** - Remove the `.github/workflows/sphinx.yml` file from the repository as it's not needed for a React project and likely fails or never runs\n\n## Files to Modify\n\nNone - this task only involves file deletion.\n\n## Files to Create\n\nNone - this task only involves file deletion.\n\n## Files to Delete\n\n- `.github/workflows/sphinx.yml` - Python Sphinx documentation workflow that's not applicable to this React project. The workflow contains Python-specific steps like `pip install`, Sphinx documentation building, and GitHub Pages deployment for Python docs.\n\n## Tests to Add\n\nNo tests are needed for this change as it involves removing an unused CI workflow file that doesn't affect the application code.\n\n## Risks and Considerations\n\n- **No functional impact**: The Sphinx workflow is specific to Python documentation generation and has no relevance to this React project. Since the project no longer has Python documentation structure (no `docs/source/` directory, no `docs/requirements.txt`), the workflow would fail if triggered.\n- **GitHub Actions cleanup**: Removing this file will clean up the Actions tab in GitHub by eliminating a workflow that's not applicable to the current codebase\n- **No dependencies**: This workflow file is not referenced by any other files in the repository - it's a standalone GitHub Actions workflow\n- **Safe deletion**: The file can be safely removed without any impact on the React application, its build process, or any other workflows\n- **Version control safety**: The file will remain in git history if ever needed for reference (though there's no reason it would be needed for a React project)",
